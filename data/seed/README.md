# `data/seed`

Seed datasets used for initial demos and local development.

Recommended contents:
- A documented schema for nodes (including geometry) and starter records
- A small “starter nodes” dataset that matches the MVP map experience

Guidelines:
- Avoid including personal location history or sensitive data.
- Prefer anonymized/public reference sources and explicit licenses for any images.

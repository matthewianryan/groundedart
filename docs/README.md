## About

Grounded Art is a location-based art discovery web app. Users see starter nodes on a map. When they physically enter a node’s geofence, they can submit a photo verification of the artwork. Verified submissions increase reputation and tier, unlocking more nodes and features. Posting publicly requires artist credit fields and may optionally require an on-chain tip receipt later.

Grounded art is intended to be an application that helps users find art, interact with and support artists, and in time create communities. The core experience for users is that they first see a sparse map of a couple popular spots to begin their journey. Once there, when they take pictures of art they enjoy, they unlock further functionalities within the app, like being able to see more nodes, more images of art at locations, able to filter and get tailored recommendations. We check this with geofencing verification. They "level up" by visiting real art galleries, crediting artists in their posts, and optionally making small crypto wallet donations to artists. Their photos taken of art are weighed up against a matrix that defines the best resolution image, with least glare, least obstructions, best overall image quality, and uses that as the display image, until a better one comes along. 

## Core pillars

- Verified capture: prove you were on-site and took the photo.
- Attribution + consent: bind captures to an artist/artwork record with clear rights defaults.
- Discovery: map-first UX (feed later) surfacing nearby art + verified content.
- Value loop: route value to artists (tips, unlocks, licenses) without heavy friction.
- Trust + anti-abuse: layered verification + reputation without mandatory identity.

## Rubrics

# Grounded Art

Grounded Art is a location-based art discovery app built around *proof-of-presence*: you unlock and contribute content by physically visiting real-world art (galleries, murals, sculptures) and submitting verified captures.

The long-term intent is a trustable public map of local art that:
- Makes discovery effortless (map-first, feed later).
- Rewards “doing the work” (visiting, attributing, verifying) with progressive unlocks.
- Routes value back to artists (tips/receipts later) without forcing heavy identity.

## Core loop (MVP)
1. View a sparse set of starter nodes on a map.
2. Arrive on-site → pass a geofence check-in.
3. Capture and upload a photo with attribution.
4. Automatic + human-in-the-loop verification improves trust.
5. Verified contributions increase curator rank and unlock more nodes/features.
